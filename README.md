## üíª Experience & projects

AI Engineer Intern @ **Bosch Global Software Technologies Vietnam**<br>
_Jun 2023 - Nov 2023_
- Researched, developed, and evaluated algorithms using machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect various types of animation bugs in video
- Collected and curated a dataset of approximately 100 video recordings of failed test cases caused by animation bugs 
- Categorized these test cases based on the visual anomalies, and conducted research to develop solutions
- Designed, implemented, and evaluated a deep learning model to detect and classify video defects, achieving over 90% accuracy in initial testing<br>

A project portfolio can be found in this [*repository*](https://github.com/NgKhaiPhu/Video-defect-detection-using-Deep-Learning-techniques)

**Interpretable Machine Learning in Image Classification Tasks**<br>
Graduation thesis<br>
_Jan 2024 - Aug 2024_
- Contributed to the development of a new class-specific localization technique leveraging Grad-CAM and Shap-CAM to generate visual explanations in the form of heatmaps
- Designed and conducted various experiments to quantitatively demonstrate that our method achieves moderately shorter execution time than Shap-CAM, while still producing relatively reliable results
- Authored and edited the final thesis, which details the development of the method and presents the findings from the experiments
